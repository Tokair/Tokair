Hello, I'm Miguel and this is my first github repository.
If you're from the future and you are interviewing me for a job interview, remember that I program since 2023, so that you know how long I've been programming.
I'm from Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·.
I like to study philosophy and music.
Favorite games: FNAF, Minecraft, Terraria, Zelda OoT, chess.
I also like chess and math.
